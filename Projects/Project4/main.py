    # Build a new version of the TCP data that has the checksum set to zero.

    # Concatenate the pseudo header and the TCP data with zero checksum.

    # Compute the checksum of that concatenation

    # Extract the checksum from the original data in tcp_data_0.dat.

    # Compare the two checksums
